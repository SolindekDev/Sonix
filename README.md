# Sonix OS

This is a simple **x86_64 32bit operating system**. **Sonix** name is taken from my **username Solinde**k and **crossed it with Unix name**. Kernel is written in **C Programming** language but bootloader is written in **Netwide Assembly (NASM)**.

### This helped me sooo much some of code is from here:
- https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial
- https://github.com/FRosner/FrOS/

### To build this OS you need to open cmd in folder where is Makefile file and write this command:
```shell
make
```
