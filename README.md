# Sonix OS

This is a simple **x86_64 32bit operating system**. **Sonix** name is taken from my **username Solinde**k and **crossed it with Unix name**. Kernel is written in **C Programming** language but bootloader is written in **Netwide Assembly (NASM)**.

### This helped me sooo much some of code is from here:
- https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial
- https://github.com/FRosner/FrOS/
- https://github.com/torvalds/linux

### What about Sonix OS project?
This project is a simple operating system, **it's just for learning**, **so I don't want to create a new Linux**. so the Sonix project **will not be continued**, **but soon I will take up a new better operating system!**

### To build this OS you need to open cmd in folder where is Makefile file and write this command:
```shell
make
```

### To build OS you need this packages:
- `86x_64-elf-gcc`
- `86x_64-elf-ld`
- `x86_64-elf-gdb`
- `qemu-system-i386`
- `nasm`
